### **Real-Time Weather-Driven Grid Simulation**

#### Introduction

This project is a Java-based interactive grid simulation that visualizes live weather data from a remote server and demonstrates dynamic environmental interactions. The grid represents a small ecosystem of actors (cats, dogs, birds) responding to rain, temperature, and wind data streamed in real time.

The program integrates:

* Event-driven UI rendering with AWT
* A weather listener system using observer design
* Streamed data processing with lambdas
* AI-like environmental behavior where actors adapt to changing conditions

#### Use of AI Assistance in Project Development

This project was developed independently at home, with all coding managed through the team’s Git repository. Due to limited class attendance and time constraints, all the tasks from week 6 - 11 were summarized and completed at once instead of going through every week's tasks individually. For this project, I used ChatGPT and Google as supplementary learning tools. ChatGPT was used only for guidance and concept clarification, not for generating direct solutions. For example, I asked about relevant Java OOP concepts, classes, and interfaces needed to implement specific features, then applied that knowledge to write the code myself. All final implementations reflect my own understanding and work.

\*\*\*\*\*This statement is included to maintain transparency and academic integrity regarding the role of AI tools in the completion of this project.\*\*\*\*\*

#### Basic Functionality of the Game

* Displays a 20x20 grid where each cell reacts to real-time weather data.
* Rain cells appear bluish, temperature cells show a blue-to-red gradient, and wind is visualized by white arrows.
* Actors (cats, dogs, birds) appear on the grid.
* They avoid hazardous cells like - 
* Rain intensity greater than 0.35
* Temperature greater than 0.75
* If trapped in hazard zones, they move randomly to safer cells.
* The HUD shows the current state, weather event counts, wind magnitude, and hover cell info.

#### Expected Output and Behavior

When the program runs:

* A window opens with a 20x20 blue grid.
* Background changes dynamically with weather:
* Rain shows deep blue zones.
* Temperature shows colors from blue (cold) to red (hot).
* White wind arrows appear pointing in live wind direction.
* All colors (caused by the hud values) are smoothed and decayed over time.
* Colored actors (cat = cyan, dog = yellow, bird = green) are visible.
* Weather data changes gradually, fading over time.
* Actors automatically avoid hot (red) or rainy cells.
* The HUD updates with weather details under your cursor in the terminal.

#### The out Folder

The out folder contains compiled .class files generated by the Java compiler.

#### The .rvb File

The .rvb file defines the initial layout of the simulation: grid size, actor placement, and stage configuration. It allows you to test or reload new layouts without recompiling code.

#### Design Patterns Used

* Observer Pattern: Used between WeatherService and WeatherListener (Stage implements the listener). This allows live updates to propagate automatically without tight coupling.
* State Pattern: Used with StageState and HumanTurnState to modularize control flow.
* Model-View Separation: Grid and Cell hold data, Stage manages rendering and interactions.

#### Stream Operations and Lambdas

Lambdas and streams are used throughout to simplify code:

* grid.cellAtColRow(...).ifPresent(a::setCell);
* weatherService.addListener(stage::onWeather);

Random moves use ThreadLocalRandom streams. These improve readability and reduce verbose code.

#### Code Limitations and Errors

* Weather data depends on the live server availability (http://13.238.167.130/weather).
* Window size is fixed. So, sometimes actors go out of sight.
* No collision detection between actors. 
* Temperature overlay sometimes reduces contrast. Color contrast is not precise.
* Actor AI moves randomly.
* Only one stage file (stage1.rvb) supported.
* No save/load functionality.
* Deprecated AWT warnings may appear on compile.

#### Git Commands Usage

* git init
* git add .
* git commit -m "Initial commit"
* git commit -am "Added weather and AI"
* git push origin main
* git status
* git log
* git restore <file>
* git rm -rf --cached <folder>

#### How to Compile and Run

Requirements- 

* Java JDK 17 or higher
* Terminal or command prompt
* Internet connection

Commands:

1. javac -encoding UTF8 -d out $(find src -name "\*.java")
2. java -cp out rvb.Main

Windows PowerShell alternative:

1. Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Filter \*.java | ForEach-Object { javac -encoding UTF8 -d out $\_.FullName }
2. java -cp out rvb.Main
